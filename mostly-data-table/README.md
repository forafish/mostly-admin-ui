# About mostly-data-table

**Mostly data table** is derived from the [Saulis iron-data-table](https://github.com/Saulis/iron-data-table).

It has been adapted to provide infinite scrolling on data retrieved from a [mostly-page-provider](https://github.com/mostlyjs/mostly-elements/blob/master/mostly-common/mostly-page-provider.html) element passed as a parameter.

Column filtering and sorting is also plugged to the [mostly-page-provider](https://github.com/mostlyjs/mostly-elements/blob/master/mostly-common/mostly-page-provider.html)'s parameters and sorting feature.
